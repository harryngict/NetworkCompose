## III. Integration

### 3.1. Integration through CocoaPods

To integrate NetworkCompose into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, add the following to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'NetworkCompose', '~> 0.0.2'
```
then run:
```bash
pod install
```
### 3.2. Integration through Swift Package Manager (SPM)
To integrate NetworkCompose using Swift Package Manager, add the following to your Package.swift file:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/harryngict/NetworkCompose.git", from: "0.0.2")
],
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourTargetName",
        dependencies: ["NetworkCompose"]
    )
]
```
Replace "YourTargetName" with the name of your target. Then, run:
```bash
swift package update
```

## IV. Basic setup
`NetworkCompose` provides a set of abstractions and components to manage your network requests. Here's a basic setup using `NetworkBuilder` and `NetworkQueueBuilder`.

``` swift
let baseURL = URL(string: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com")!
let network: NetworkBuilder<URLSession> = NetworkBuilder(baseURL: baseURL)
let networkQueue: NetworkQueueBuilder<URLSession> = NetworkQueueBuilder(baseURL: baseURL)
```

## V. Making Requests
Now, let's see how to make various types of network requests using `NetworkBuilder` and `NetworkQueueBuilder`.

### 5.1. Async/Await Request
```swift
let request = NetworkRequestBuilder<[User]>(path: "/posts", method: .GET).build()
let result: [User] = try await network.build().request(request)
// Handler \(result) here
```

### 5.2. Completion Handler Request
```swift
let request = NetworkRequestBuilder<[User]>(path: "/comments", method: .GET)
        .setQueryParameters(["postId": "1"])
        .build()
        
network.build().request(request) { (result: Result<[User], NetworkError>) in
    // Handler result here
}
```

### 5.3. Re-authentication
```swift
 let request = NetworkRequestBuilder<User>(path: "/posts", method: .POST)
        .setQueryParameters(["title": "foo", "body": "bar", "userId": 1])
        .setRequiresReAuthentication(true)
        .build()

networkQueue.setReAuthService(self) // setReAuthService to enable re-authentication
            build()
            .request(request) { (result: Result<User, NetworkError>) in
                 // Handler result here
             }
```
We have to conforms to the `ReAuthenticationService` protocol, which allows you to handle re-authentication.
``` swift
    public func reAuthen(completion: @escaping (Result<[String: String], NetworkError>) -> Void) {
        // For testing now. In fact, this value should get `newtoken` from the real service
        completion(.success(["jwt_token": "newtoken"]))
    }
```

### 5.4. SSL Pinning
```swift
let sslPinningHosts = [NetworkSSLPinningImp(host: "jsonplaceholder.typicode.com",
                                            hashKeys: ["JCmeBpzLgXemYfoqqEoVJlU/givddwcfIXpwyaBk52I="])]

let request = NetworkRequestBuilder<User>(path: "/posts/1", method: .PUT)
            .setQueryParameters(["title": "foo", "body": "bar", "userId": 1])
            .build()

try network.setSSLPinningPolicy(.trust(sslPinningHosts)) // setSSLPinningPolicy to enable SSL Pinning
           .build()
           .request(request) { (result: Result<User, NetworkError>) in
                 // Handler result here
            }
```

### 5.5. Network Metric
```swift
let request = NetworkRequestBuilder<User>(path: "/posts", method: .POST).build()

try? network.setMetricInterceptor(DebugNetworkMetricInterceptor()) // setMetricInterceptor to report metric
            .build()
            .request(request) { (result: Result<User, NetworkError>) in
                // Handler result here
            }
```

Report will show us the information of request, task, session, etc..
```

### 5.6. Smart Retry
```swift
 let request = NetworkRequestBuilder<User>(path: "/posts/1/retry", method: .PUT)
        .setQueryParameters(["title": "foo"])
        .build()

// exponential retry
let retryPolicy: NetworkRetryPolicy = .exponentialRetry(count: 4,
                                                        initialDelay: 1,
                                                        multiplier: 3.0,
                                                        maxDelay: 30.0)
network
    .setDefaultConfiguration() //  reset all configurations
    .build()
    .request(request, retryPolicy: retryPolicy) { (result: Result<User, NetworkError>) in
        // Handler result here
    }
```

### 5.7. Automation Test
```swift
let request = NetworkRequestBuilder<User>(path: "/posts", method: .GET).build()

network.setNetworkStrategy(.mocker(self)) // setNetworkStrategy to mocker
       .build()
       .request(request) { (result: Result<User, NetworkError>) in
          // Handler result here
        }
```
We have conforms to the `NetworkExpectationProvider` protocol, allowing you to provide network expectations for testing purposes.

```swift
public var networkExpectations: [NetworkCompose.NetworkExpectation] {
      let apiExpectation = NetworkExpectation(name: "abc",
                                              path: "/posts",
                                              method: .GET,
                                              response: .successResponse(User(id: 1)))
      return [apiExpectation]
}
```
### 5.8. setDefaultConfiguration
The setDefaultConfiguration function is available to reset all configurations for `NetworkBuilder` and `NetworkQueueBuilder`
```swift
network.setDefaultConfiguration()
networkQueue.setDefaultConfiguration()
```

Thats it!! `NetworkCompose` is successfully integrated and initialized in the project, and ready to use.
